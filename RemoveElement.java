     * of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed.
     * Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
     *
     * Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k.
     * To get accepted, you need to do the following:
     *
     * 1. Change the array nums such that the first k elements contain the
     *    elements which are not equal to val.
     * 2. The remaining elements of nums are not important, as well as the size.
     * 3. Return k.
